## Call for features
We receive tons of features requests from users and like the following features most:
* Display the view number in the top-right of our homepage by retrieving the number from our Google Analytics
* Need better interavtive visualization for showing historical data trend
* Multi-lingual site development. As not everyone in AU is proficient in English, we hope that users can switch to their native language when using our site.
* A dedicated page for nice intreactive visualization for our data including age, gender, suburb distribution of confirmred cases, increasing number in each state, ICU beds in each hospital, etc.

If you are interested in one or more of these features, welcome to the PR and our team will review all PRs from time to time.
Once your PR is merged to our project, we will explicitely list you in the contributor list of this project.
Looking forward to your great works. **Note**: Please make sure that if you do submit a pull request, that it is to the 'dev' branch.
