Australia is in a unique position, in that it has two viable options. The first is to completely eliminate all active cases in the country before lifting any major state or border restrictions. This would be attained when all cases fall to zero for approximately <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://go8.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Go8-Road-to-Recovery.pdf'>2 weeks</a>.",

The second is to suppress the cases of the disease below the capacity of health systems. However this method is likely to lead to spikes in local cases, for example, the resurgence of disease in Singapore. Perhaps, it might be helpful to consider other experimental choices, for example a recent <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.esade.edu/itemsweb/wi/research/ecpol/EsadeEcPol_Insigth6_Exit_Strategy.pdf'>proposal</a> in which people are allowed to move within disconnected areas such as suburbs and districts, which are progressively joined together as the spread is contained, this is similar to what has been done in Wuhan.",

Even with the alcohol, the concentration would be unlikely to have any effect, as rubbing alcohol varies widely in concentration so it’s impossible to know the concentration – and therefore the efficacy – of the final product.",

                    "Another set of studies focuses on how the virus spreads in the environment. One example is a major study from the New England Journal of Medicine <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2004973'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a> which characterized the stability of COVID-19 in different surfaces.

                    "Another category studies resource allocation of non-therapeutic equipment and assesses when they may show shortages. One study uses the Global burden of disease, injuries, and risk factor data to determine how accessible handwashing stations are in low-income countries <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href=' https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.07.20057117v1.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>. This study uses prediction models to show how sufficient supplies of facemasks are in China, under the current guidelines, indicating there is only a 1 week supply which can be mitigated by scaling production by 42% <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>.",
                    "Of the most pressing concern for other studies, is to evaluate whether or not face masks should be used as a non-therapeutic intervention. This comes from the many discrepancies about the usage of face masks from different authorities. While the use of surgical masks has been promoted in Asian countries, the World health organization, Europe and North America do not promote this practice. Some including the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bosnia, and Herzegovina, and Australia however, have changed their recommendations. The following article provides an extensive systematic review of the current literature regarding facemasks, with an effective overview of how masks' effectiveness changes depending on the setting (household, facemasks), effectiveness in community settings and mass gatherings, and how it can interfere with ordinary activities <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528v1.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>.",
                    "As one of the main problems deterring health organizations from recommending facemasks is the shortage of supply, different strategies have also been proposed. The first possible way is exploring ways to disinfect used masks, so they can be reused. Some of these studies examine cheap, easily deployable disinfection practices <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.20050443v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>.

Another examines how studies show how effective the usage of home-made masks is in preventing environmental contamination, rather than protecting the individual from infection.",
                    "<h3 class='responsiveH3'><strong>How to move forward and what needs to be done</strong></h3>",
                    "While there does seem to be some amount of studies being published in regards to non-therapeutic interventions, we can always do better and in many cases, it is still not enough. Here are some of the key limitations we believe might be missing from the picture.",
                    "Firstly, we need to determine how major non-intervention strategies in middle and low-income countries prevent disease. Some studies are already in place, for example, estimation studies in Colombia <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20063727v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>. The validity of these studies, however, is coupled with problems due to poor testing capabilities, and the possible real number of cases can be estimated through other methods such as assessing sewage systems for COVID-19 particles. ",
                    "Most studies currently are either experimental or observational, and there are no random clinical trials (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of these measures. The most pressing gaps in knowledge that are coming from this epidemic, is our lack of consensus about the validity of masks. However aside from assessing masks and their use in curbing COVID-19 infections, there are also numerous other that deserve attention, such as handwashing and eye protection equipment. What are some alternatives if these resources are not available? What resources can be provided to individuals with allergies to the product used? What are the consequences of wearing these equipment long term? ",
                    "Aside from addressing new questions, it is important to note that, conducting poor quality RCT after pandemics had been a recurring pattern. A new systematic study<a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.20047217v2.full.pdf'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a> assesses the validity of randomized clinical trials conducted in relation to influenza and influenza-like illness after the 2003 SARS epidemic. Of over 2000 clinical trials, all but 100 were immediately omitted from the assessment. Of these 100 studies, there was no significant effect on the use of almost every non-therapeutic intervention which included masks, handwashing, eye protection for influenza. This does not suggest nothing we do actually but helps us, but highlights that much of studies till now have been too low quality and messy to allow us to drive any positive  conclusions.",
                    "So how would we correct the mistakes from the past? It has been suggested one possible way would be to have  more transparency in randomized clinical trials in regards to non-therapeutic interventions. This in fact is a very broad problem in which all trials performed under any context, aside from vaccines or drugs have been poorly regulated, and they require registration in most countries, especially in the US and EU. Transparency in what studies have been conducted is the first step towards standardising the way these trials are conducted <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='citationLink' href='https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1323.abstract'><small class='cite'>[1]</small></a>. Perhaps, with the number of new dashboard technologies that could be utilised to monitor and track upcoming trials, similar to those proposed for important clinical trials.",
                    "Aside from randomised clinical trials, what can we do to improve observational studies? Since these studies analyse patterns in data, after the event has passed, documented case information is important. However, the government and others globally provide clear uniform ways of updating case numbers, without consistencies between every province and country. Typically researchers judge the specific material used for protective coverings from government directions and also pictures of the public and what a majority uses. Explicit, direct instructions on how to implement interventions would also be appreciated, such that there is less guessing work. ",
                    "Lastly, research on the best way to educate and inform the public on how to comply with non-intervention measures as well as the importance of these measures, is heavily needed. We did not come across any of these studies in the current pre-prints, but this is a critical factor especially in countries where there might be poor literacy, as well as to educate and take care of those in the public who might be unable to understand these guidance due to different restrictions.",

                    "We present data in many formats to make our website as accessible and useful to everyone. For example, we use interactive geographic data visualisation to help Australians to see infection hotspots on a map and the impact of COVID-19 on Australia as a whole.",
                    "<h3 class='responsiveH3'><strong>Why we do it</strong></h3>",
                    "We believe that by helping people to be more informed of the situation in Australia and the impact of this pandemic on the country as a whole, Australians will be encouraged to come together as a community to do their part to protect their country such as following Government guidelines to prevent the spread of the outbreak. We also think that it is important for people to understand what data tells us, so that they can appreciate the importance of Government guidelines.",
                    "<h3 class='responsiveH3'><strong>How we've grown</strong></h3>",
                    "We have been promoting our project on multiple social media platforms, and since then, many new students from multiple Universities around Australia and people working in the IT industry have chosen to volunteer their time to help.",
                    "This project has not been easy to manage. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we are unable to meet up to work on the project together and most of us have never met each other before. We have to rely on constant online communication in order to facilitate collaboration between different teams. However, we are able to overcome our hardships through sharing a common goal of wanting to do our part to help our country and Australians during this difficult time.",
                    "This project is entirely run by volunteers and the website is designed for non-commercial use only. For the students working on this project, it is an incredibly opportunity to see how the skills we have learnt during the course of our education can be applied in the real world. More importantly, it is extremely rewarding to know that we have the ability to give back to our society and do our part to help Australia during this crisis.",
                    "<h3 class='responsiveH3'><strong>How you can help</strong></h3>",
                    "We want to make out website useful to everyone so we always take into consideration users’ feedbacks and try to implement their feature suggestions. To stay connected with our users, we interact with them through our social media platforms where we update multiple times each day with daily reports and other content to help everyone stay positive during this challenging time. We want to be a supportive community and help each other get through this incredibly challenging time by spreading positivity. We aim to do this by providing hope for Australians and showing that we can combat this outbreak TOGETHER.",
                    "Thanks to the efforts of our dedicated team, our website now has over 4 million views. We are still trying to expand our reach so that we can help as many people as possible with this platform. If you would like to support us, please share our website with your friends and family. We hope our website can be a platform that Australians can rely on during this stressful time!",
