Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victoria may not yet have hit the peak of its latest surge in cases. Professor Sutton said the virus had an average incubation period of about five or six days, which meant case numbers would not start to plateau for another few days."

With Victoria reporting another 238 cases of the illness, and another fatality, Sutton said he would \"love\" elimination, but now wasn’t the time to make \"a detailed examination about its feasibility\".
